# The Value of Accessibility: A Business Case for A11y

## Abstract

Accessibility is a growing concern in the developer community, but the question of "Why" still lingers in the air. Why should a developer care about accessibility? Why should a private business invest in accessibility? One answer is money.

In 2019, Federal Courts ruled that a pizza chain must make their web platform accessible in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. That is just one of many recent rulings holding businesses accountable for accessibility. Not to mention that 1 in 5 visitors to your website will have some form of disability - that's 20% of your users! This isn't only for public facing websites, either. The ADA also requires internal websites to be accessible.

This session outlines the business case for accessibility - why it's important and what the ROI for accessibility could be - as well as presenting the possible costs associated with ignoring accessibility. Take the notes from this session, or take the slides themselves, and present them to your business team. Help make the web accessible to everyone!
