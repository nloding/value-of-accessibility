negative motivations - lawsuits, liabilities

positive motivations - increased customer base, easier use, lower operational costs, aligning values

let's start with some high level numbers

71% of disabled people abandon websites which presents access barriers (http://www.clickawaypound.com/downloads/cap16final2711.pdf)
96.8% of the worlds top 1M websites have clear accessibility issues (https://webaim.org/projects/million/)
93% of disabled people don't report issues (clickaway study)
ecommerce sites that enhanced usability doubled sales (https://www.nngroup.com/reports/ecommerce-user-experience/)

e-commerce
$517B in 2018 in North America
2% were blind (per Deque commissioned study)
$10.3B for just blind users
more than 70% of e-commerce sites aren't accessible (https://accessibility.deque.com/nucleus-accessibility-research-2019)
that translates to $6.9B annually
consumer's don't not buy that thing - they go where they can buy it

brick and mortar are driving people to digital spaces - *it costs less*
think about companies offering you discounts if you use ACH, or go paperless, etc.
blind internet users call customer service one a week (internet is unavailable deque paper)
omni-channel business - cost per transaction (AlixPartners https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-omnichannel-age-is-here-and-its-expensive/597653/)

IBM study says 100x more expensive to fix something in production than during development

Dominos - cost to fix: $38,000 ... cost for 5 years of litigation up to SCOTUS ... MORE THAN 38k!

true cost of non-compliance is 2.7x greater

71% of customers prefer buying from companies aligned with their views

team training can increase your profits: https://web.archive.org/web/20160417011136/http://www.protential.ae/corporate-training-importance-areas-and-roi-investments/ (increases employee confident/efficiency, lowers turnover)


thinking about how to fix your existing issues:
- start with an accessibility statement that acknowledges the gaps and lays out your plan
- use a tool like aXe to scan for the low hanging fruit
- start ensuring that new features have "shifted left"

budget has multiple stakeholders
- nobody wants to spend their budget on it - IT, compliance, customer service, no one
- allocate budget to all teams to address a11y - take away argument "oh you're using my budget to fix X's issue" (centralized funding)
- all departments kick in the same amount, or a percentage based on their allocation to the digital side
- mandate

Deque statistics:
- coming in late, it took 10-15% of development time to retrofit
- starting at the beginning, they found it took 1-3% of development time. more efficient teams lowered that barrier.

ROI of hiring a SME vs training internally

Case Study: Tesco, from 2001 - 56k modem era
why do i still include this? because it isn't just disability accessibility, it's general usability gained from it that grew revenue. the overall online experience became more usabled and therefore more profitable

Launched Tesco.com in 2000
Fixed usability issues in 2001

    Many organisations are waking up to the fact that embracing accessibility leads to multiple benefits â€“ reducing legal risks, strengthening brand presence, improving customer experience and colleague productivity.

CONCLUSION
but here's one thing we didn't talk about but need to.
if your site wasn't accessible, that new market isn't using your site.
you need to market to people with disabilities.
do you have disabled user personas?
are you measure disabled user engagements?
