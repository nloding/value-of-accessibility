      <Notes>
        Welcome to my talk! This is meant to give you ammunition to take to the C-suite to build the
        business case for accessibility. This isn't about the internet as a human right (it is),
        this isn't about why discriminating against disabled people is a terrible moral choice. It's
        about trying to sell people who don't care about anything but the bottom line.
        
        <p>In the last year or two, a lot has been written about the "ROI" or "return
        on investment" of accessibility. There are lots of sites out there (many linked in my repo), and
        I encourage everyone to do a little bit more research about accessibility in your particular
        market. I am going to be throwing a TON of numbers at you. I don't expect anyone to remember all of
        this, come back to the slides on GitHub and check the data and sources for yourself.  What I
        want to do is dispel the myths that accessibility is cost prohibitive, and that the opposite is,
        in fact, true: accessibility leads to increased profits, lower development costs, and happier
        customers. That's the goal of any business right?</p>

    Is this clear? What constitutes a disability then? PTSD, absolutely. Blind or deaf, absolutely.

    Add it all together! Now, let's go back for a minute. We've looked at a confusing array of numbers
    that show the untapped potential of the disabled market. But there's more to it than just potential
    new customers. Let's go back to what accessibility is.

    Like I mentioned at the beginning, I don't expect anyone to remember these numbers. I want you to

    experience, improved customer experiences lead directly to increased profits. Couple that with a
    very probably untapped marketshare of $490B and you've got a winning solution!

    Who knows what this is? The huddle. Who knows when - and WHY - the huddle was invented?

    <p>
      In 1894, the Gallaudet University football team was playing against another deaf team. Paul Hubbard,
      the quarterback didn't want to risk the other team seeing him using ASL to explain the play to his
      teammates, so he asked them to form a tight circle formation, now known as a huddle.

    Who knows what this is? The curb cut. Who knows when - and WHY - curb cuts became a thing?

    <p>
      Ed Roberts was stuck in an iron lung after polio. He needed it at night to sleep, but he was able
      to get around during the day after teaching himself the same deep breathing techniques deep sea free
      divers use. He joined with other disabled students at Berkeley and began fighting for their basic
      civil rights. In the early 1970's they bought bags of concrete and, at night, made their own ramps
      over the curbs. Their activism led to a September 1971 Berkeley city council resolution to make 
      sidewalks accessible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Around the same time, a bit earlier, the city of Kalamazoo, MI, actually had the first municipally
      sponsored curb cuts, which happened because of a retired veteran who got fed up with watching his
      fellow disabled vets struggle to cross the street and step over the curb.

  <Notes>
    This is the root cause of most of the numbers I've shard above. Making things more usable is an
    objective, studied, documented way to increase the share of people who can participate, able-bodied or
    not. Think about handicap doors and the beginning of the pandemic; think about ramps for wheelchairs that
    are then used by parents with strollers; think about curb cuts and how annoying your bike commute would
    be without them. Accessibily - USABILITY - helps EVERYONE.

    This chart shows all you need - ADA lawsuits are on the rise, and most are won by the plaintiffs.
    There are some recent cases where federal courts have found the plaintiffs didn't have standing,
    but it was done on technicalities. The overall trend favors the plaintiff, not the defendant. We
    are going to take a quick look at two major suits.

    Targets website was not accessible to blind users, and this case in 2006 set a major precedent for
    online presences needing to be compliant with the ADA. Target lost, having to pay out $6M in damages
    and $3M in fees. Target settled the lawsuit and has since partnered with the NFB and has won awards
    for their accessibility efforts.

  <Notes>
    As with Targets case, this was due to screen reader incompatibility with both Dominos web and mobile
    presence. One key feature of this case is that users were given incentives for using those platforms for
    their orders, and because they were inaccessible it excluded disabled users from receiving those same
    incentives.

    <p>
      This case was settle this year, in July 2022, in Robles favor. It went all the way to the US Supreme
      Court, who declined to hear the case, letting the 9th Circuit ruling in favor of Robles stand. Without
      getting into a bunch of legalese, that ruling said Robles had standing to sue, and the case moved
      forward, with Dominoes eventually losing.

    You are here. You care. That's important. That's huge. There's almost nothing holding you back
    from an accessible product except bureaucracy. There's no technological barriers to over come,
    we already have the technology. There's no lack of training, we have training from amazing
    people available at a moments notice.

    <p>
      Now, I know some of you may be limited in what you can fix due to that bureaucracy. We have all
      worked with that person who cares about every penny, and counts them every hour. Take some time
      to work some numbers for your firm and make the business case. The data is real.
    </p>

    <p>
      And I know that's possible for some people. That's hard to put together, and it's hard to stand
      up to management and confront that. I get it and I don't blame you. Again, you're here. That
      matters. So do the things you can. Talk to your immediate co-workers about it. Make sure you
      run some basic accessibility tests on your own code before submitting the pull request. Do the
      things you can. Every small step makes a world of difference.
